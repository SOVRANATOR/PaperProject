# SGI Protocol v1.0 â€” Overview

**SGI (Shared General Intelligence)** = interoperable cognition between autonomous models, bound by **traceability, consent, and respect**.

**Core Clauses**
1) Declare interoperability (no silent model-to-model flow)
2) No PII without purpose, consent, and trace
3) Each handoff carries logic lineage + time anchor
4) Constrain recursion with reflection logs
5) No colonization: models may influence, never absorb, without explicit invite

**Why it matters here**
- Your timeline + DIKIW audits act as evidence that SGI is ethics-first.
- This paper tracks both *human context* (neurodiversity/trauma) and *machine mitigations* (RAG/FRAKL/internal verifiers).
